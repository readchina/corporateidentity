# READCHINA Corporate Identity
The corporate identity files for ERC READCHINA, including the logos, symbol and other design elements to be used on posters, presentations and online.  

## READCHINA Logos
The files used for designing our logo are in the `logo/adobe` folder. The logo was designed in Adobe Illustrator CC 2015 and all changes to it should only be made using this software or its newer versions.

### Adobe
There are three `.ai` files that make up our logo:
-   full (symbol + wordmark + description),
-   semi-full (symbol + wordmark), and
-   symbol (just the symbol).

### SVG
`logo/svg` contains non-proprietary vector graphics for our logos for e.g. inclusion on web-pages, or in print.           

### ERC Logo
The official ERC logo can be found [here](https://erc.europa.eu/managing-your-project/communicating-your-research). We are including the four versions of it in this repo to make future design work smother.

## How To
As a rule, we use the **semi-full logo** for most wide-screen and/or big print cases. The symbol can be used as an icon, watermark or simple image. The full logo is reserved for special situations (and we might discard it altogether eventually).

Each of the three comes in two versions: A is on white background, B is on transparent background. We use A when the background on which the chosen logo will be placed is black or multicolored (e.g. a photo or multicolored graphic). We use B when the background on which the chosen logo will be placed is white or colored but the logo is still clearly readable without an added white background around it. As a rule, the logo should be placed at the edges and be clear and readable.

## Stylesheets
The CSS and color scheme to be used throughout our presentations and online will be added to this repo soon.

### Fonts
The font family and types to be used throughout our presentations and online will be added to this repo soon.

## Templates
PowerPoint, Letterhead and similar boilerplates.
