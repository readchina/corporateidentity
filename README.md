# READCHINA Corporate Identity
The corporate identity files for ERC READCHINA, including the logos, symbol and other design elements to be used on posters, presentations and online.  

READCHINA LOGOS

There are three files that make up our logo: full (symbol + wordmark + description), semi-full (symbol + wordmark) and symbol (just the symbol). 

As a rule, we use the semi-full logo for most wide-screen and/or big print cases while the symbol can be used as an icon, watermark or simple image. The full logo is reserved for special sitautions (and we might discard it altogether eventually). 

Each of the three comes in two versions: A is on white background, B is on transparent background. We use A when the background on which the chosen logo will be placed is black or multicolored (e.g. a photo or multucolored graphic). We use B when the background on which the chosen logo will be placed is white or colored but the logo is still clearly readable without an added white background around it. As a rule, the logo should be placed at the eges and be clear and readable. 

READCHINA CSS & COLOR SCHEME
